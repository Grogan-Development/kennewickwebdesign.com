## Logo Requirements

### Style Direction
- **Should feel**: Modern, premium, trustworthy, local
- **Should NOT feel**: Generic, corporate, boring, "gamer," overly complex
- **Consider**: The name is "Grogan" or "grogan.dev" - could use initials "G" or a creative mark

### Color Usage
- Primary: Use the `#3b82f6` blue or `#f59e0b` amber
- Background: Transparent (must work on dark and light)
- The website uses dark backgrounds primarily

### Icon/Mark Ideas (for inspiration)
- Something geometric and clean
- Could incorporate a "G" or play with code/bracket symbols (since it's web design)
- Local reference: Could subtly reference the Tri-Cities or Washington (optional, not required)
- Speed/growth arrows (ranking, leads, growth are key selling points)

### Must Work
- At small sizes (favicon, navbar)
- At large sizes (hero section, business cards)
- In white/dark mode
- As a monochrome mark

### Deliverables Needed
1. Primary logo (full name "grogan.dev" or "Grogan")
2. Icon/mark version (just the graphic)
3. Favicon version
4. Color variations (full color, white only, blue only)

## Competitor Context

The website's competitors in the Tri-Cities are likely:
- Other local web designers using WordPress templates
- Slow, bloated sites with poor SEO
- This site differentiates through: speed, modern tech, SEO focus, local presence, transparency

The logo should feel noticeably more premium and modern than typical local web designer logos.
